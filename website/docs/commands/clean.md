The `clean` command deletes all of the files generated by `scala-cli`. This includes the `.scala-build` directory where Scala CLI writes outputs and stores its caches, and `.bsp/scala-cli.json` file which contains details for the BSP connection (necessary for importing a Scala CLI build to your IDE of choice).
